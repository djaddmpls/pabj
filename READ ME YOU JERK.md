***PERSONAL ATTACK BLACKJACK***

This is a CLI Blackjack game in Python. to run the game, use ```python pabj.py```.

(You have to have python installed)

-On Windows, hit WIN + X and open Command Prompt or Windows Powershell
-You should start out in the Windows\user Directory. Navigate to the directory aka folder you saved this in.
-My game folder is saved on my desktop, so I type 'cd desktop\pabj' in order to "Change Directory" to the folder where the game is saved
-Once inside Windows\User\..\pabj> Then type 'python pabj.py' to run program.

**If you are not sure which directory you have the file saved in, you can type DIR for a list of folders in your current directory.

-On MAC pretty much same instructions but open 'Terminal' from your Utilities folder

I hope you eat shit.
